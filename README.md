Project 1 - Apart Board Game with Prolog
- Human vs Human;
- Human vs Computer;
- Computer vs Computer;
- Bot lvl 1 (random) and Bot lvl 2 (greedy);
- AI program using Minimax algorithm with board evaluation to predict oponnent's movements.

Project 2 - Haskel Compiler
- Low-level machine with configurations of the form (c, e, s) where c is a list of instructions to be executed, e is the evaluation stack, and s is the storage.
- The instructions of the machine are: push-n, add, mult, sub, true, false, eq, le, and, neg, fetch-x, store-x, noop, branch(c1, c2) and loop(c1, c2.
- Development of a small imperative programming language with arithmetic and boolean expressions, and statements consisting of assignments of the form x := a, sequence of statements (instr1 ; instr2), if then else statements, and while loops.
- Development of a compiler from this language into lists of instructions in the previous machine.
- Development of a parser and lexer which transforms an imperative program represented as a string into its corresponding representation in the Stm data (a list of statements Stm) ready to be compiled.
