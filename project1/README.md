## Descrição do jogo

"Apart" is a strategic game for two players that takes place on a square board, usually of odd size, such as 5x5 or larger. The board starts empty, and the players alternate their moves, representing their pieces on the board. Player 1's pieces are identified by the symbol "A," while player 2's pieces are represented by the symbol "B."
The aim of the game is to create a situation in which your pieces are not adjacent to your opponent's pieces. To place a piece in a certain position on the board, the adjacent positions (above, below, left and right) must contain an equal number of the player's and opponent's pieces.
Players try to create configurations that prevent their opponent from making a valid move. When a player can no longer place his pieces on the board, he loses the game. In other words, the player prior to being unable to play wins the game. Draws never occur in this game.
The game involves strategic planning and tactics to block the opponent while keeping movement options available. It's a game that challenges players' ability to anticipate and strategize, making each match unique and exciting.
